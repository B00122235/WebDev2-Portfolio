    <p>My name is Dylan and I am a student currently studying Creative Digital Media in the Institute of Technology Blanchardstown, now re-named to Technological University Dublin. I have always had a passion for media and have always been interestd in the variety of skills you develop throughout learning about anything media related. I chose this course as I felt that it was the best course to get the best out of me creatively and help me build a number of different skills that would help me in the future.

  <aside> 
    <p> My biggest interests are photography and storytelling/film making. I have always found that I enjoy these subjects the most as I like developing new ideas and coming up with things that are unique whether it's creative writing or developing different characters. I have had previous experience with black and white photography and am currently learning a lot about editing images in photoshop. I also enjoy designing and the process of getting to a final design that is unique, at first I was uncomfortable with designing as I felt it was one of my weaker points, but I have built a lot of confidence through designing posters. </p> </aside> <br>
